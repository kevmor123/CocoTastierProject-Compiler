# CocoTastierProject-Compiler
For this module we had an ongoing assignment where we had to construct the programming language Tastier using C#. We were given a sample that we have to edit each week for our assignments. We first had to allow the language to handle the addition of comments to the ‘.s’ file for each of the identifiers found in the code, this had to correctly represent its symbol table. This was done by having the console write a line in the ‘.s’ file printing its symbol table each time in the code by getting the kind, type and level found by accessing the given variable in the current scope in the code.
